# Phase 2 – Progress Summary & Updates

**Date:** September 19, 2025  
**Scope:** Blog built with Node.js microservices (api-gateway, users, posts, comments, ui) + MongoDB. Local first (Docker Compose), then AWS ECS Fargate (Spot). Shift‑left security, CI/CD, observability, and cost controls.

---

## What Was Created/Updated (This Session)
1) **Implementation Guide (Canvas #2):** Full step‑by‑step plan for Phases 2.0–2.11, including goals, files, commands, acceptance criteria, security notes, and LinkedIn templates per phase.  
2) **Repo Description (Canvas #1):** Concise ≤350‑char description + architecture summary, local run, security baseline, AWS minimal‑cost approach, and a kickoff LinkedIn post.

---

## Current Status
- Architecture defined; repo layout and standards specified.  
- Detailed steps to implement users/posts/comments, gateway, UI, local Compose.  
- Security & CI/CD roadmap drafted (pre‑commit, Semgrep, Gitleaks, Trivy, ZAP; GitHub Actions).  
- AWS deployment plan set (ECR, SSM, ECS Fargate, single ALB → gateway).  
- Code scaffolding & commits: **pending execution** (next working session).  

---

## Next Actions (Immediate)
1) Initialize Node projects and add minimal code for `users`, `posts`, `comments`, and `api-gateway`.  
2) Create `docker-compose.yml`, set `.env` files from examples, and run locally.  
3) Add pre‑commit + Gitleaks/Semgrep configs; verify hooks block issues.  
4) Commit & push initial baseline to GitHub.

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Secret leakage:** Use `.env` (git‑ignored) and SSM in AWS; Gitleaks in pre‑commit/CI.  
- **Cost drift:** Fargate Spot for non‑prod; single ALB; MongoDB Atlas M0.  
- **Security gaps:** Semgrep/ZAP baselines; RBAC enforced at gateway and services.  
- **Debuggability:** JSON logs + correlation IDs; CloudWatch for ECS tasks.

---

## Change Log (to be updated each phase)
- **2025‑09‑19:** Created Canvas #2 (Implementation Guide) and Canvas #1 enhancements were referenced. Set acceptance criteria and LinkedIn templates.

## Summary (One‑paragraph)
We designed Phase 2 end‑to‑end: a microservices blog using Node.js/Express and MongoDB, orchestrated locally via Docker Compose and deployable to AWS ECS Fargate (Spot) behind a single ALB. Security is embedded from the start with pre‑commit hooks, Gitleaks, Semgrep, Trivy, and a ZAP baseline in CI. The plan includes RBAC, a lightweight Bootstrap UI, observability, Atlas backups, and explicit cost controls. Next, we scaffold code, run locally, then wire CI and deploy to AWS.
